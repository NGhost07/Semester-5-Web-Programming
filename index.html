            A company that has grown by 15000% since 2001 should be doing something that most of the others aren’t
            doing. Interested to know the name and other details of such a company? Well, it is the most famous
            company that we know today, i.e. Apple Inc. There must be a long history of Apple. Like all other
            companies, there would be a point where the company would have been started, then passed numerous phases
            to reach to the current stage where Apple computers and other products are known as the trademark of
            quality.
        </p>

            you to find a number of Apple products. Whether they are in the form of iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or macOS,
