                    A company that has grown by 15000% since 2001 should be doing something that most of the others aren’t
                    doing. Interested to know the name and other details of such a company? Well, it is the most famous
                    company that we know today, i.e. Apple Inc. There must be a long history of Apple. Like all other
                    companies, there would be a point where the company would have been started, then passed numerous phases
                    to reach to the current stage where Apple computers and other products are known as the trademark of
                    quality.

                <p class="main__element-content">
                    Apple is amongst the top few companies in the IT sector. You don’t particularly have to go through the
                    internet to find out the current level of success of Apple Inc. rather you can just have a look around
                    you to find a number of Apple products. Whether they are in the form of iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or macOS,
                    each of the products has an established market. If you are wondering about the profit that Apple
                    Incorporation earns, then you’ll be amazed to know that Apple Inc. has made a profit of US$59.531
                    billion in the year 2018.

                    strong position in the US market. Years of consistent focus on product quality, as well as research and
                    development, have helped the brand grow its popularity faster. According to its annual report for 2019,
